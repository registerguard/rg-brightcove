Our simple Brightcove styling

Right now we don't have much styling on our Brightcove player, that could change in the future. This is to make sure that any changes are in version control.

Forgive the `!important`s, but that was the only way we could get the styling to take.

**NOTE: Brightcove takes a few minutes to update the styles after you change them.**
